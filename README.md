## Description Of The Project

I have created a simple project by taking Snap Shot as my base.

> [Deployed App Link](https://front-end-final-project-nef5p7zx1-aselesra.vercel.app/)

- Snap Shot is a gallery created using React,React Hooks, React Router and Context API. The Routes were setup for four default pages and a search page. Also the images were displayed using the Flickr API and axios to fetch data.


Final result:
